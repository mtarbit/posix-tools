POSIX Tools
===========

This is a probably misguided attempt to re-create a few of the simpler
standard shell tools or utilities from scratch. Mainly as a way to get
a better understanding of C and *nix programming.

Ideally they'd be compliant with the
[shell & utilities section](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/)
of POSIX.1-2008 but we'll see how we go.

If it's not immediately obvious I don't really know what I'm doing, so
don't go using these yourself unless you want your machine to go up in
a puff of blue smoke.
